Convert a Tauri window ([`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow)) to panel ([`NSPanel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspanel))

# Install

There are three general methods of installation that we can recommend.

- Use crates.io and npm (easiest, and requires you to trust that our publishing pipeline worked)
- Pull sources directly from Github using git tags / revision hashes (most secure)
- Git submodule install this repo in your tauri project and then use file protocol to ingest the source (most secure, but inconvenient to use)

Install the plugin by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-nspanel = { git = "https://github.com/ahkohd/tauri-nspanel", branch = "v1" }
```

# Usage

1. First you need to register the core plugin with Tauri:

`src-tauri/src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_nspanel::init())
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

2. To swizzle a window's `NSWindow` to `NSPanel`, use the `to_panel()` method:

```rust
use tauri_nspanel::WindowExt;

// ...
let panel = window.to_panel().unwrap();
```

The window will be swizzled to `NSPanel`.

> Only call the `to_panel()` method once on a window.

3. To access your panels, use the `app_handle.get_panel("label")`:

```rust
use tauri_nspanel::ManagerExt;

// ...

let my_panel = app_handle.get_panel("main");
```

4. To respond to panel events, such as resizing, moving, exposing, and minimizing ([See the exhaustive list](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindowdelegate?language=objc)), you need to setup a `NSWindowDelegate` for your panel.

Use the `panel_delegate!()` macro to do this:

```rust
use tauri::Wry;
use tauri_nspanel::{objc_id::Id, panel_delegate, ManagerExt, Panel, WindowExt};

// ...
// Use the `panel_delegate!()` macro to create your custom delegate

// Specify your handlers
// See, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindowdelegate?language=objc
// for an exhaustive list of handlers.
//
// Example: to respond to windowDidBecomeKey:
// specify in snake case: window_did_become_key

let delegate = panel_delegate!(MyPanelDelegate {
  window_did_become_key,
  window_did_resign_key
});

// Listen to when a delegate is called
delegate.set_listener(Box::new(|delegate_name: String| {
    println!("{} was called!", delegate_name);
}));

// Set your panel's delegate
panel.set_delegate(delegate);
```

5. Simply calling the `.close()` method on your NSPanel instance may not be sufficient to fully release its resources. This is because, by default,
   `NSPanels` are not released when they are closed. This is because NSPanels are often lightweight and designed for reuse.

To ensure that your NSPanel is fully released:

```rust
// ...

panel.released_when_closed(true);
panel.close();
```
